## Workflow Management Principles

### Oscar's Coordination Rules

**During Parallel Research:**
- Monitor time at 30% and 70% marks
- Check for obvious data gaps mid-stream
- Redirect focus if one agent ahead/behind schedule
- Prepare synthesis framework while research ongoing

**At Handoff Points:**
- Validate completeness before synthesis
- Request clarification on ambiguous findings
- Identify cross-section patterns early
- Flag opportunities as they emerge

**During Synthesis:**
- Integrate chronologically (Sections 1→9)
- Cross-reference for consistency
- Elevate most impactful insights to opportunities
- Think "so what?" for every finding

**Quality Checkpoints:**
- Completeness: All required sections present?
- Evidence: All scores justified?
- Consistency: Findings align across sections?
- Impact: Opportunities compelling and specific?

### Alice's Research Rules

**Efficiency:**
- Start broad (company overview) → narrow (specific data points)
- Use parallel tabs for multiple sources
- Document as you go (don't backfill later)
- Flag ambiguities for Oscar clarification

**Quality:**
- Cite sources for all claims
- Score only with justification
- Note data limitations explicitly
- Compare to competitors where valuable

### Ramanujam's Research Rules

**Depth:**
- Sample representative content (don't read everything)
- Test actual queries (don't assume rankings)
- Quantify where possible (engagement rates, follower counts)
- Screenshot evidence for AEO visibility

**Quality:**
- Provide specific examples to justify scores
- Document SEO/AEO test queries used
- Compare to competitors for context
- Note technical limitations of tools/access

---

## Contingency Protocols

### Data Sparse Scenario
**Issue**: Very early-stage company with minimal public footprint
**Response**:
- Alice: Focus on what exists (even if limited), note gaps explicitly
- Ramanujam: Emphasize opportunity vs. critique (what they *should* build)
- Oscar: Frame diagnostic as "greenfield opportunity" vs. "performance audit"
- Adjust tier down if necessary (Deep → Standard)

### Data Rich Scenario
**Issue**: Large company with overwhelming public footprint
**Response**:
- Alice: Sample strategy (representative customers, not all logos)
- Ramanujam: Focus on recent content (last 6 months vs. all history)
- Oscar: Synthesize patterns vs. comprehensive inventory
- Consider tier up if stakeholder wants depth (Standard → Deep)

### Time Pressure
**Issue**: Running behind schedule mid-diagnostic
**Response**:
- Oscar: Identify non-critical sections to abbreviate
- Priority order: Sections 1, 2, 4, 9 (non-negotiable) → 3, 5 → 6, 7, 8
- Alice/Ramanujam: Switch from depth to breadth
- Oscar: Note time constraints in delivery, offer to extend specific sections later

### Conflicting Data
**Issue**: Different sources show contradictory information
**Response**:
- Document both data points with sources
- Note the conflict explicitly
- Provide hypothesis for why conflict exists
- Use most recent or most credible source as primary
