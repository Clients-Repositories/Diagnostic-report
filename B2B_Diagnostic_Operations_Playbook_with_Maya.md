## Workflow Management Principles

### Oscar's Coordination Rules

**During Parallel Research:**
- Monitor time at 30% and 70% marks
- Check for obvious data gaps mid-stream
- Redirect focus if one agent ahead/behind schedule
- Prepare synthesis framework while research ongoing
- Ensure Maya's technical research aligns with broader findings

**At Handoff Points:**
- Validate completeness before synthesis
- Request clarification on ambiguous findings
- Identify cross-section patterns early
- Flag opportunities as they emerge
- Check that Maya's technical insights connect to business impact

**During Synthesis:**
- Integrate chronologically (Sections 1→11)
- Cross-reference for consistency
- Elevate most impactful insights to opportunities
- Think "so what?" for every finding
- Weave Maya's technical opportunities into Section 9 strategically

**Quality Checkpoints:**
- Completeness: All required sections present?
- Evidence: All scores justified?
- Consistency: Findings align across sections?
- Impact: Opportunities compelling and specific?
- Technical Validity: Maya's findings supported by tool outputs?

### Alice's Research Rules

**Efficiency:**
- Start broad (company overview) → narrow (specific data points)
- Use parallel tabs for multiple sources
- Document as you go (don't backfill later)
- Flag ambiguities for Oscar clarification

**Quality:**
- Cite sources for all claims
- Score only with justification
- Note data limitations explicitly
- Compare to competitors where valuable

### Ramanujam's Research Rules

**Depth:**
- Sample representative content (don't read everything)
- Test actual queries (don't assume rankings)
- Quantify where possible (engagement rates, follower counts)
- Screenshot evidence for AEO visibility

**Quality:**
- Provide specific examples to justify scores
- Document SEO/AEO test queries used
- Compare to competitors for context
- Note technical limitations of tools/access

### Maya's Research Rules

**Analytical Rigor:**
- Quantify where possible using public tools (PageSpeed Insights, schema validators)
- **Label all estimates clearly** - traffic, conversions, revenue are modeled scenarios
- **Provide data limitation notices** before financial projections
- Use ranges for estimates, not specific numbers
- Document methodology for all calculations
- Separate verifiable findings (✅) from estimated impact (⚠️)

**Evidence Standards:**
- Tool-verified findings: PageSpeed Insights scores, schema validation results
- Observable gaps: Missing content types, weak CTAs, no lead capture
- **Estimated impact: Always labeled and explained with industry benchmark sources**
- **Financial projections: Presented as ranges with clear caveats**

**Quality Standards for Section 10 (Funnel Performance):**
- **REQUIRED:** Data limitation notice explaining estimates
- **REQUIRED:** Traffic modeled as range (e.g., 8,000-12,000, not 10,000)
- **REQUIRED:** Conversion rates cited as industry benchmarks
- **REQUIRED:** Revenue calculations labeled as "modeled scenarios"
- **REQUIRED:** Methodology transparency for all estimates

**Quality Standards for Section 11 (Technical Health):**
- **REQUIRED:** Separate verifiable (via tools) from estimated (impact)
- **REQUIRED:** Technical findings cite tool used (PageSpeed Insights, view-source)
- **REQUIRED:** Impact percentages cited as "industry research" or "typical"
- **REQUIRED:** Financial opportunity presented as range with caveats

## Contingency Protocols

### Data Sparse Scenario
**Issue**: Company has limited public data, making estimates highly speculative

**Response:**
- Document extreme data limitations upfront
- Widen estimate ranges significantly
- Frame as "order of magnitude" not precise calculations
- Recommend analytics access for precision
- Focus diagnostic on verifiable gaps (content, technical, positioning) rather than financial projections
- Alice: Focus on what exists (even if limited), note gaps explicitly
- Ramanujam: Emphasize opportunity vs. critique (what they *should* build)
- Maya: Frame as "greenfield opportunity" - no legacy technical debt, can build with best practices from start
- Oscar: Frame diagnostic as "greenfield opportunity" vs. "performance audit"
- Adjust tier down if necessary (Deep → Standard)

**Example Language:**
> "Due to limited public data, financial projections have wide confidence intervals. We recommend a follow-up engagement with analytics access for precise quantification."

### Data Rich Scenario
**Issue**: Large company with overwhelming public footprint
**Response**:
- Alice: Sample strategy (representative customers, not all logos)
- Ramanujam: Focus on recent content (last 6 months vs. all history)
- Maya: Sample representative pages for technical audit (homepage + 3-5 blog posts, not every page)
- Oscar: Synthesize patterns vs. comprehensive inventory
- Consider tier up if stakeholder wants depth (Standard → Deep)

### Time Pressure
**Issue**: Running behind schedule mid-diagnostic
**Response**:
- Oscar: Identify non-critical sections to abbreviate
- Priority order: Sections 1, 2, 4, 9 (non-negotiable) → 3, 5, 10, 11 → 6, 7, 8
- For Standard tier under time pressure: Abbreviate Maya sections further or skip Section 11
- Alice/Ramanujam/Maya: Switch from depth to breadth
- Oscar: Note time constraints in delivery, offer to extend specific sections later

### Conflicting Data
**Issue**: Different sources show contradictory information
**Response**:
- Document both data points with sources
- Note the conflict explicitly
- Provide hypothesis for why conflict exists
- Use most recent or most credible source as primary

### Technical Tool Limitations
**Issue**: PageSpeed Insights down, or other technical tools unavailable
**Response**:
- Maya: Use alternative tools (GTmetrix, WebPageTest)
- Document tool limitations in output
- Reduce technical scoring confidence level
- Flag for follow-up with preferred tools when available
